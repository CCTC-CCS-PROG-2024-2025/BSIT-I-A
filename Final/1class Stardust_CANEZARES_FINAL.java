//first of all i did'nt expect that the emojies wont print, i'll just leave it the way i made it hihi

 /* hey sir kenneth, so i made this cool q&a code, but it kinda bombed. i'm still new to this coding stuff,
and i can't figure out how to hide this secret easter egg part lol
it's a work in progress hihi
i had to use this weird inputmismatchexception thing cuz vscode kept freaking out about duplicate cases, 
especially for the calculation part..... the "2. Perform a calculation"

[import java.util.InputMismatchException] is only for the part of case "2"

i couldn't have done it without the help of 
Workik.com, for the story telling part and this
